If you're developing on macOS, then you probably know what we're going to talk about: [**Homebrew**](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) üç∫ the most popular package manager for macOS. 

If you don't know Homebrew, it's a command-line tool that allows you to install software on your Mac. We could call it "the missing app store" for your console. But Homebrew is much more than that! There is an entire ecosystem of contributors that maintain formulas to make it easy to install software on your Mac.

Today I have the honor to speak with [**Mike McQuaid**](https://twitter.com/MikeMcQuaid), the Homebrew project leader. In this episode we're going to talk about how Homebrew started, how it works internally, how it's funded, and how you can contribute to it. I'm glad I also had the chance to touch on some more contentious topics like **telemetry** and **handling burnout** in the OSS space.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
