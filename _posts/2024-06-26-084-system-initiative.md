Today we talk about a completely new topic: DevOps and System configuration. I'm really excited to have on stage [**Adam Jacob**](https://twitter.com/adamhjk), CEO and Co-founder of [**System Initiative**](https://www.systeminit.com/).

Adam is challenging the status quo of DevOps tools with a completely **new approach** to system configuration. While System initiative looks like a no-code tool at first, it comes with all the power of TypeScript to let you build and manage your infrastructure in a completely new way.

We will talk about the history of System Initiative, the challenges of building a new tool in a crowded space, and the future of DevOps.

Adam is also the co-founder of [Chef](https://github.com/chef/chef), a really popular configuration management tool, and he will share with us some of the lessons learned from that previous experience.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
