‚ò¢Ô∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è When Gradle or the IDE let you down, just `--nuke` all them caches ‚ò¢Ô∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è

Today's project is basically a script: [**deep-clean**](https://github.com/rock3r/deep-clean).

This script is the last resort to unblock yourself when your Android/JVM/Gradle builds are damn broken.
deep-clean will take care of cleaning up your build caches. If you're really stuck, you should also look
 into the `--nuke` option to purge every possible cache and start from a clean environment.

Its author, [**Sebastiano Poggi**](https://twitter.com/seebrock3r), is on stage to tell us the story behind it.

As a bonus, we also talk a bit about Seb's new journey with Twitch: [CodeWithTheItalians](https://codewiththeitalians.it) üçï.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
