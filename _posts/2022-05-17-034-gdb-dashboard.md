Have you ever debugged an application using **gdb**? If yes, you probably know how _unfriendly_ the user interface of gdb is.
That's why [**Andrea Cardaci**](https://github.com/cyrus-and) developed [**gdb-dashboard**](https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard/), a graphical interface for gdb.

Today, we'll walk through how this project started and we'll talk about some of the challenges of developing graphical applications for terminal.

Andrea is also an Application Security Specialist. In this episode, he's going to share of security tips & stories with all of us.
