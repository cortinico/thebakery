I'm really excited for today's episode as we're going to talk about Linux Desktop Environments with [**Niccol√≤ Venerandi**](https://twitter.com/veggero), a KDE contributor.

Niccol√≤ has been contributing to KDE Plasma for multiple years. He's going to tell us how the KDE project is working, how it's funded and how it is possible to contribute to it.

He also runs a popular YouTube channel about KDE & Linux that he's using to found his Open Source work!

In this episode, we're going to learn his secrets and how he's planning to grow his engagement with KDE through this channel.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
