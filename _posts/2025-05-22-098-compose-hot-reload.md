Since it's KotlinConf week we do have a special new episode for you folks! üéÅ

Today we have on stage [**Sebastian Sellmair**](https://twitter.com/sellmair), software engineer at JetBrains, and he's here to talk about **Compose Hot Reload**.

With Compose Hot Reload, you can make changes to your Jetpack Compose code and see the results instantly in your app without having to restart it! This means you can iterate faster and get immediate feedback on your changes, which is arguably a huge game-changer!

In this episode, Sebastian will walk us through the story of this project, how it works internally, and why you need a custom JVM to make it work. He'll also share some insights on how to test Hot Reload and what the future holds for this project.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
