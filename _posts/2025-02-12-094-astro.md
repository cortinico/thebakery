In this episode of The Developers' Bakery, we explore [**Astro**](https://astro.build/), the modern web framework, with [Elian Van Cutsem](https://twitter.com/ElianCodes), one of its maintainers. Elian will walk us through Astro‚Äôs content-first approach, how it compares to other web frameworks, and its support for server-side/hybrid rendering.

We also dive into Astro‚Äôs governance model and the challenges of maintaining an open-source project at this scale. Elian will also share his insights on the latest Astro 5 release and what‚Äôs next for the project.

Finally, we chat about FOSDEM! We'll share some of our personal anecdotes from the conference which just happened in Brussels, so you don't want to miss this episode!
