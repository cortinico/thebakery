Today we talk about Golang! On stage we have [**Camden Cheek**](https://twitter.com/camden_cheek), the creator of [**conc**](https://github.com/sourcegraph/conc) a library for structured concurrency in Go.

Camden will walk us through what are the common pitfalls of Go's concurrency model and how conc can help you to write better and safer goroutines. We will touch on how this library started within Sourcegraph and how it gained so much popularity so quickly. 

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
