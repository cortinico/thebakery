If you don't know FastHub yet, it's one of the most popular Github client for Android. It's obviously **fully open-sourced** and Kosh has been developing it from day 1. Today he's sharing with us the story of this project, how it started and how it evolved.

Make sure you don't miss this episode as we're going to talk about a lot of topics: the the FastHub **business model**, how Kosh handled **piracy** problems and what is the future for this project.  

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
