Building a chat client is hard. 

Sending messages, uploading attachments, and handling reactions are all tedious and quite complicate tasks that are common to a wide variety of apps. Those are the foundation of the [**Android Stream SDK**](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/). With Stream you can build a customized chat experience for your mobile apps. The various SDKs are completely open-source and are available for several platforms (Web, iOS, Android and even gaming platforms).

Today we have [**Filip Babiƒá**](https://github.com/filbabic) on stage, Android UI Team Lead at Stream, to walk us through their Android SDK. Specifically, Stream is offering both an Android **XML** SDK and a **Compose** SDK. We're going to talk about the differences between the two, and the challenges of building a chat SDK to serve millions of messages.
