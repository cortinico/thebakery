Hi everyone, today is time to talk about **GraphQL**! We have on stage [**Tanmai Gopal**](https://twitter.com/tanmaigo), CEO and co-founder of [**Hasura**](https://hasura.io/).

Hasura is an open-source GraphQL engine that helps you build and scale your GraphQL APIs, basically 'without' limits! We'll talk about the history of Hasura, how it works, and what's next for this project. Join us in this episode as Tanmai will tell us his story founding Hasura and how they're building a vibrant ecosystem around this project.
