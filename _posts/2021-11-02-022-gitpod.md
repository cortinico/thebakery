In this episode we're back on the topic of **Cloud IDEs** with [**Geoffrey Huntley**](https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley) to talk us about [**Gitpod**](https://www.gitpod.io/) üöÄ.

First, I had the pleasure to ask Geoff some insights on his _van life_ ‚õ∫Ô∏è. Geoff is living remote work at its finest, working from his van in Australia and apparently enjoying it a lot (make sure to checkout [his blogposts about it](https://ghuntley.com/tag/vanlife/))!

But Geoff is also highly involved with Gitpod, a tool that will help you spin-up **development environment** and get you up to speed in seconds. They're also extremely supportive towards the open-source ecosystem, offering free licenses for OSS projects.

In this epidesode we walk through Gitpod, how it can help you in your daily development and what the future of Cloud IDE might look like.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
