I'm excited to welcome on stage our next guest [**Guilherme Oenning**](https://twitter.com/goenning), creator of [**Aptabase**](https://aptabase.com/)!

[**Aptabase**](https://aptabase.com/) is an open-source tool to collect and analyze analytics from your users. The key feature is that it's designed with privacy in mind, as all the events are stored anonymously. It's fully GDPR-compliant and it's available either as a cloud service or as a self-hosted solution.

Join us in this episode, where Guilherme will tell us the story of how Aptabase grew from a side project to successful product!

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
