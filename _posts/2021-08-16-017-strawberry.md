Today we touch a bit on the Python 🐍 world as I have the honor to have on-stage [**Patrick Arminio**](https://twitter.com/patrick91), author and maintainer of [**Strawberry**](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry) 🍓.

Strawberry is a **GraphQL library** for Python 3. It comes with a lot of nice features built on top of language feature such as **dataclasses** and **type hints**.

Patrick is also doing an amazing work in building a **vibrant community** around this project.
In this episode he will walk us through the story of this project, and some of the community initiatives he started to support this project.

Enjoy the show 👨‍🍳
