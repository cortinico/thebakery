We're celebrating this milestone with a special episode.
The tool we're going to talk about today is not a Github library, but a sport that is getting more and more popular in the developer community: **Running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**.

I'm excited to have on stage [**Enrique L√≥pez-Ma√±as**](https://twitter.com/eenriquelopez), GDE for Kotlin & Android, Maitnainer of Kotlin Weekly and (Ultra) Marathon runner. 

Enrique will share with us his passion for running and will tell us how **software engineers** can **benefit** from this sport. He has also been successufully running Kotlin weekly for the last 5 years, so he has a lot to tell about **endurance** as well.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
