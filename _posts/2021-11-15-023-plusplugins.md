It's been since [episode #07](/07) that we haven't talked about Flutter üíô, so today we have [**Miguel Beltran**](https://twitter.com/MiBLT) on stage to talk about one of the most important library for it: [**Plus Plugins**](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/plus_plugins).

Miguel is one of the maintainer of this popular **collection of plugins**. Plus plugins offer multiplatform capability to access informations 
such as **battery**, **connectivity**, **sensors** and more across a variety of platforms: Android, iOS, Web, MacOS, Windows & Linux!

In this episode we will talk about the story of this project, how it evolved from Google to Flutter community, and
how people can **contribute** to such a critical piece of the Flutter ecosystem.
            
Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
