It's time for another bonus episode of The Developers' Bakery! üéâ

Today, I'm extremely excited to have on stage [**Xavier Damman**](https://twitter.com/xdamman), co-founder of [**OpenCollective**](https://opencollective.com/)!

If you've been doing open source for a while, you've probably heard about OpenCollective. It's a platform that helps open-source projects and communities to raise funds and manage their finances transparently. But OpenCollective is much more than just a way to support open-source projects, as you can support and fund all sorts of community initiatives.

In this episode we'll talk about the story of OpenCollective, how it all started, and how it grew to become the platform we all know today. We'll also discuss the challenges of running a platform like OpenCollective, the future of open-source funding, and much more!

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
