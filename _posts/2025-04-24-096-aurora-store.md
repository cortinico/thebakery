We're back with a fresh new episode at The Developer's Bakery! üéâ

In this episode, we chat with [**Aayush Gupta**](https://mastodon.social/@theimpulson), the maintainer of [**Aurora Store**](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraStore), a popular alternative to the Google Play Store.

Aayush will share what makes Aurora Store unique, including its features, security measures, and how it compares to other similar stores like FDroid.

We'll deep dive into some of the technical aspects of Aurora Store, discussing topics such as anonymous login, malware protection, and much more.

As a bonus, Aayush is also a moderator at XDA Developers, one of the biggest Android community out there, and will share his journey getting into it.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
