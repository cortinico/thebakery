In this episode of The Developers' Bakery we touch on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and a middleware to overcome one of its missing capability with [**Michele Riva**](https://twitter.com/MicheleRivaCode) and [**Krabs**](https://github.com/micheleriva/krabs) ü¶Ä

Krabs is a Express.js/Fastify middleware that will help you deploying **multi-tenancy** application on Next.js.
We're going to walk through what this tool does and why it was even needed in the first place.

Michele is also a **book author** and has a lot of opinion on programming languages. We're going to hear a bit
about his experience writing a book and some of his lessons learned.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
