Today we're going to talk about [**Excalidraw**](https://excalidraw.com/) üé®, a web tool to sketch diagrams with a hand-drawn style.

I'm glad to have on stage [**Aakansha Doshi**](https://twitter.com/aakansha1216), one of the maintainer of Excalidraw, to tell us more about this project.
Aakansha will tell us the story of Excalidraw, how it evolved over time, and its secret to achieve the distinctive hand-drawn style.

We'll also talk about the community around Excalidraw, and Aakansha will share some tips on how to start contributing to your first open-source project.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
