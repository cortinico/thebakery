In this episode we are going to meet [**Xavier Gouchet**](https://twitter.com/xgouchet) and the [**Datadog Android SDK**](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-sdk-android) üê∂.

Datadog helps you monitor and track problems with your mobile applications, such as crashes and ANR. The Android SDK
offers a large variety of plugins that helps you track the health of your app with integration for popular libraries
such as Timber, Glide, Jetpack Compose or the Android NDK.

In this episode, Xavier will walk us through their SDK and what are the most challenging tasks for a monitoring SDK such as this one.
