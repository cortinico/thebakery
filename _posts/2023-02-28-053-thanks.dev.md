Today we don't talk about a specific Open Source project, but about a tool that can help us build a more sustainable ecosystem: [**thanks.dev**](https://thanks.dev).

I have the pleasure to have on stage [**Armin Nehzat**](https://twitter.com/anehzat), Growth Officer of thanks.dev, a donation and sponsoring platform for open-source projects.

The key feature of thanks.dev is how it manages to scan your **dependency tree** and discovers all the projects you build on top, so you can split your donations to all of them. Similarly as a maintainer, you can get a fraction of a donation, even if you're down in the dependency chain of someone else.

Join us in this episode as Armin walk us through the challenges of connecting donors with maintainers in a sustainable way.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
