Time for a fresh new episode! This time we'll touch on a really different topic: **Digital Signing**. Joining us today is **Pete Matsyburka**, co-founder of  [**Docuseal**](https://www.docuseal.co/).

Docuseal lets you sign documents online in a secure and easy way, similar to other popular alternative such as Docusign. The killer feature of Docuseal is that it is **open source**, and you can either self-host it or use the hosted version.

Join us in this episode where Pete will tell us about his journey, how they bootstrapped Docuseal, and the future of the project.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
