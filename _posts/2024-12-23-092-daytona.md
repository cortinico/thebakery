We're back with another episode about developer tools! Today, we‚Äôre diving into [**Daytona**](https://www.daytona.io/) üöÄ, a self-hosted and secure open source **development environment manager**.

I‚Äôm thrilled to have on stage [**Ivan Burazin**](https://x.com/ivanburazin), CEO and co-founder of Daytona, to tell us more about this project.

Do you recall how much time it takes you to have your development environment ready? Think about how many hours you spend setting up your machine, installing dependencies, and configuring your IDE. Daytona aims to solve exactly this problem by providing a development environment that can get you up to speed in seconds!

In addition, Ivan will walk us through the story of Daytona: how it started and what‚Äôs next for this tool.

Ivan also has a lot of experience in conference organization. In this episode, we'll touch on what he learned from creating tech conferences and how that skills helped him build Daytona today.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
