Today I'm excited to have on stage [**Daniele Scasciafratte**](https://twitter.com/mte90net), the _Open Source Multiversal Guy_. Daniele is involved all over the places: he's a WordPress core contributor, a Mozilla contributor, and the author of the book "Contribute to open source: the right way". 

In this episode, we start from [**GlotDict**](https://github.com/Mte90/GlotDict), a browser extension Daniele wrote to support WordPress translators. But that's just the starting point! We'll touch on what is means to be a WordPress core contributor, how Mozilla is different from WordPress and the love/hate relationship we all have with PHP.

Daniele also wrote an **Open Source book**: "Contribute to open source: the right way". This book is like a survival guide for any Open Source newcomer. We'll talk about how the book came to be and what are the main takeaways from it.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
