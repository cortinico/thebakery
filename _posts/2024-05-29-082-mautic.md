Time for a brand-new topic today, as we're going to talk about **Marketing Automation**.

I'm excited to have on stage [**Ruth Cheesley**](https://twitter.com/RCheesley), who's going to tell us all about [**Mautic**](https://www.mautic.org/). Mautic is a marketing automation software, that helps you manage your email campaigns, track your user engagement, and much more. It's fully open-source (written in PHP üêò) and works either as self-hosted or as a cloud solution.

But we're also going to talk about another crucial topic in open-source: **governance models**. Ruth has been supporting the Mautic community for years, and helped them navigate through a governance model change. She's going to share what worked and what not for Mautic and give us some tips on how to manage a community project.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
