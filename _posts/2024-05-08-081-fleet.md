Today we touch on a brand-new topic: device management! I'm excited to have on stage [**Zach Wasserman**](https://twitter.com/thezachw), co-founder and CTO at [**Fleet**](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet).

Fleet is a Mobile device management (MDM) software, that helps you manage your device fleet. It's fully open-source and works either as self-hosted or as a cloud solution. Zach is going to guide us through the world of fleet management, talking about challenges such as managing vulnerabilities and updating devices.

If you ever worked with a managed device, you'll be amazed to learn some of the secrets from the device management world!
