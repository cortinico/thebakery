Time for a new episode of The Developers' Bakery! üéâ

In this episode, we dive into the world of [http4k](https://www.http4k.org/) with [David Denton](https://github.com/daviddenton), exploring how you can treat your server as a function! Thanks to Kotlin expressivity, http4k allows you to develop server applications that are easy to test and maintain.

David created and maintains the http4k together with Ivan Sanchez, and will share his story in creating this framework, which they claim it stands out as the _most testable_ web toolkit. We will also discuss their journey from an open-source project to becoming a full-fledged company.

Tune in to learn everything http4k!

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
