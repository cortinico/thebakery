It's time to kickoff 2024 with an amazing new episode! Joining us is the mind behind Homebrew: **Max Howell**.

We're not here to talk about Homebrew today though (get back to [Ep. 55](/55) for that). Max is here to tell us about his latest project: **Tea** üçµ

Tea is a new protocol to **sponsor open source**. Tea works as a decentralized network that allows you to sponsor the projects on your dependency tree. 

Join us in this episode as we walk through the possibilites that Tea unlocks, and we won't miss the chance to talk a bit about the story of Homebrew as well.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
