Time for a new episode of The Developers' Bakery! Today we're back talking about testing, but we'll have the opportunity to learn a new approach we haven't talked about in this podcast yet: **Property Based Testing**.

Joining us today is [**Nicolas DUBIEN**](https://twitter.com/ndubien), creator of [**fast-check**](https://fast-check.dev/), a library to write property-based tests for TypeScript and JavaScript.

Nicolas will guide us through the world of property-based testing, explaining how fast-check can help us to write tests that are offering better coverage of our code.

Enjoy the show 👨‍🍳
