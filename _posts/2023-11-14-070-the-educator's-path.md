We're back with another **bonus episode** of The Developers' Bakery! 
Back in episode [60](/60) we talked about content creation with Effective Android.

Today, we double down on a similar topic as we do have [**Marcin Moska≈Ça**](https://leanpub.com/u/mmoskala) on stage! Marcin is the author of **Effective Kotlin**, a collection of Kotlin best practices, and **Kotlin Coroutines**, a book about Kotlin's concurrency model.

In this episode, Marcin will walk us through the path to **becoming an educator**, what are the skills required, and how to make it profitable. Marcin has plenty of experience in this space, both as a book author, a workshop organizer, and a conference speaker.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
