Welcome to a special **in-person episode** of The Developers' Bakery, recorded live in **Berlin** at Google I/O Connect 2024!

There, I had the privilege of having on stage [**Marcello Galhardo**](https://twitter.com/marcellogalhard), Software Engineer at Google. Marcello is working in the AndroidX team responsible for adding Kotlin Multiplatform support for several popular AndroidX libraries.

If you're an Android Developer, you probably used one of those libraries in your projects, such as Lifecycle or Room. Marcello is going to walk us through the latest announcements about Kotlin Multiplatform at Google I/O, and how they're going to impact the way we build Android apps.

Enjoy the show üë®‚Äçüç≥
